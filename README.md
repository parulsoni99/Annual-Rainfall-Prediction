# Annual-Rainfall-Prediction

The aim of this project is to create a model to predict average annual rainfall of a place in the coming years using data of previous years.

# Methodology

I have collected 102 years data of two parameters i.e. average annual rainfall and average temperature in the month of June from year 1901-2002. Here, I have used two methods for building such models:

1. First method is to build a time series model of the data in R programming language and then forecast
   the data for next 25 years. 
2. Second method is to perform linear and curvilinear analysis on these parameters.

# Dataset
The data can be extracted from http://www.indiawaterportal.org/met_data/.
