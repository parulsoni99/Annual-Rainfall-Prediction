# Annual-Average-Rainfall-Prediction

The aim of this project is to create a model to predict average annual rainfall of a place in the coming years using data of previous years.

# Dataset
The data can be extracted from http://www.indiawaterportal.org/met_data/.

# Methodology

I have collected 102 years data of two parameters i.e. average annual rainfall and average temperature in the month of June from year 1901-2002. Here, I have used two methods for building such models:

1. First method is to build a time series model (used when there is no independent variable present in the dataset) of the data in R          programming language and then forecast the data for next 25 years.

2. Second method is to perform linear and curvilinear analysis on these parameters.


# Requirements
R-studio and MS-Excel should be installed in your PC.
